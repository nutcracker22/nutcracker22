### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Steffen

Last year I moved to the UK and in January 2022 I started studying 'Information Technology' at the University of Aberdeen.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on web development, since this is part of the courses I am taking.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flask, SQLite, Selenium Webdriver, and a couple more.
- I like the following operating systems: Manjaro, Linux Mint (since that has been the first Linux distro I ever used), and Pop_OS
- I am closely following the development of Android Boot Manager, an app that helps you install and multi-boot different operating systems on your mobile phone (see https://github.com/Android-Boot-Manager/App)
